In this article, we’ll take a look at the gatsby-image component and how it can simplify the process of using images in various scenarios. The steps in this guide assume you have a working [Gatsby](http://dev.nodeca.com) project. So if you haven’t already, you can get started with Gatsby by following along the Gatsby First Steps article.
### Getting Started

Let’s get started by installing the necessary plugins. Depending on the Gatsby starter you’re using, these might already be installed. Check the package.json to see if that’s the case.

### Install
We’re installing a few things here. Each play a different role in our image setup. We’ll go into further detail in a bit.

```shell
const some = {}

```
### Configuration
Now we’ll add these to our gatsby-config.js.

```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    ...
    'gatsby-plugin-sharp',
    'gatsby-transformer-sharp',
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-source-filesystem',
      options: {
        name: 'images',
        path: path.join(__dirname, `src`, `images`),
      },
    },
  ],
}
```
Notice that we are configuring gatsby-source-filesystem as well. This is to create file nodes from our images so they’re available through graphql queries. For this guide, we’re placing our images in the src/images directory.

As for our other plugins:

+ gatsby-plugin-sharp is a low-level helper that powers the connections between Sharp and gatsby-image. It also exposes several image processing functions.
+ gatsby-transformer-sharp facilitates the creation of multiples images of the right sizes and resolutions.



### Working With Images
Now that we’re set up, we can start working with images in our site. Let’s create a hero.js component to use with our images.

```javascript
import React from 'react';

export default ({ data }) => (
  <section>
    <div>
      <h1>Hi, I like websites.</h1>
      <p>Sometimes I make them.</p>
    </div>
  </section>
)
```

### Conclusion
This is only scratching the surface of what you can do with images in Gatsby. Whether you’re looking to squeeze out as much performance as possible or create a quality experience for your users, Gatsby’s rich toolset has you covered. I encourage you to read all the linked resources and play around with the plugins to find what best suits your needs.
